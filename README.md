## How to Join BuzzLeague? üìù

To join BuzzLeague, submit your valid LeetCode username along with your department, year, and email. Please ensure that your LeetCode profile lists "Chennai Institute of Technology" or "Chennai Institute of Technology and Applied Research" as your education, as this is how we verify your affiliation with CIT. If a registered student changes their username, they will be removed from BuzzLeague and will need to re-register with their new username.

## Running Locally üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lovelindhoni/buzzleague.git
```

2. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following values:

```plaintext
SUPABASE_URL=<Your_Supabase_URL>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<Your_Supabase_Anon_Key>
GITHUB_PAT=<Your_Github_Personal_Access_Token>

The SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are the credentials for your Supabase database instance. The GITHUB_PAT is your GitHub Personal Access Token which has permissions only to public repos. This environment variable is optional.

3. Run the following SQL query on the SQL editor on your Supabase dashboard to create the table with the required schema:

```sql

CREATE TYPE Year AS ENUM ('1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th');
CREATE TYPE Department AS ENUM ('CSE-AIML', 'CSE-AIDS', 'CSE', 'CSE-CS', 'CSBS', 'ECE', 'EEE', 'BME', 'MCT', 'MECH', 'SH', 'CIVIL', 'IT', 'ACT', 'VLSI');

CREATE TABLE lcusernames (
username TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
email TEXT NOT NULL,
year Year NOT NULL,
department Department NOT NULL
);
```

4. After creating the .env file, install all the dependencies by running:

```bash
pnpm i
```

5. Start the development server by running:

```

This will start the development server at localhost:5173.
